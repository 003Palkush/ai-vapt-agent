# Security Assessment Report

## Scan Information
- **Target**: https://github.com
- **Goal**: Check security headers and SSL configuration
- **Timestamp**: 2025-11-09 23:07:32
- **Agent**: VAPT Agent v1.0 (Ollama Llama 3.1)

## Executive Summary

Here is a concise 2-3 sentence executive summary of the security assessment:

Our analysis identified a potential security risk at GitHub, where server information is being inadvertently disclosed through the Server header. This exposure may facilitate reconnaissance and potentially lead to more severe attacks. We recommend implementing measures to remove or obscure this sensitive information for improved security posture.

## Findings Summary

**Total Findings**: 2
