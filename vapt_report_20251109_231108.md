## Executive Summary

Here is a concise 3-sentence executive summary:

**Security Assessment Summary**

Our analysis of http://testphp.vulnweb.com revealed two critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The site's lack of SSL encryption (NO_SSL) exposes sensitive data to interception, while the accessibility of the '/admin' path (SENSITIVE_PATH) poses a significant risk to unauthorized access. Additionally, the site's use of HTTP instead of HTTPS (HTTP_ONLY) further exacerbates these issues and should be addressed promptly.

## Findings Summary

**Total Findings**: 4

- **Critical**: 0
- **High**: 2
- **Medium**: 2
- **Low**: 0
- **Info**: 0

## Detailed Findings

### High Severity

#### 1. NO_SSL

**Description**: Site does not use HTTPS

**Recommendation**: Implement HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificate

---

#### 2. SENSITIVE_PATH

**Description**: Sensitive path '/admin' is accessible

**Recommendation**: Restrict access to /admin

---

### Medium Severity

#### 1. HTTP_ONLY

**Description**: Target uses HTTP instead of HTTPS

**Recommendation**: Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificate

---

#### 2. HTTP_ONLY

**Description**: Target uses HTTP instead of HTTPS

**Recommendation**: Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
